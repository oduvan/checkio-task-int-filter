    During last <i>I3E Industrial Conference</i>i> in Robo-city a new version of
    communication protocol R2HI 2.0 (Robot-to-Human Interface) was adopted.
    A new version of R2HI interface extend existing one in adding
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction" title="ecc">error detecting code</a> feature.
    This feature allows to send data from robots that are located
    on a long distance from human settlements with higher level of reliability.
    During the data transmission some bits can be substituted due to external
    events (radiation impact, different noises etc.). In R2HI 2.0 simple
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit" title="parity bit">parity bit</a>
    check technique is proposed.
